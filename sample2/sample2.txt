9.	Library Management System(Lms): The goal is to enable students and librarians to easily access and manage the library and run it smoothly. Each item3 library item - item0, tape cassette, CD, DVD, item1. could have its own item item2. To support it, the items may be barcoded. The purpose of barcoding is to provide a unique and scannable identifier that links the barcoded item3 item to the electronic record in the catalog. Barcode must be item3ly attached to the item, and barcode item2 is entered into the corresponding field in the electronic item record. Barcodes on library items could be replaced by RFID tags. The RFID tag can contain itemâ€™s identifier, title, material type, item1. It is read by an RFID reader, without the need to open a item0 cover or CD/DVD case to scan it with barcode reader.
